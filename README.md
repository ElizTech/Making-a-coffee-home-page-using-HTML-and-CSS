<blockquote>We want to do a lot of stuff; we are not in a good shape. We didn't get a good night rest. We are a little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.</blockquote>

<p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>, the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grounding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (<a href="brewing.html">brewed</a>), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.</p>

<p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum-packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
